# Welcome to MachineFi Lab!
_Real-world data infrastructure, powered by AI vision._

We build [Trio](https://docs.machinefi.com), a live stream intelligence service that turns any livestream into a programmable data source. Point it at a stream (RTSP, YouTube Live, Twitch, and more), ask questions in natural language, and get structured answers in real-time. One-shot checks, continuous monitoring with webhooks, and AI-generated narrative digests — all via a simple REST API.
